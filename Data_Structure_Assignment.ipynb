    "\n",
    "# 1. Ordered:\n",
    "# Lists maintain the order of the elements as they are inserted. This means that elements are stored in a specific sequence, and you can access them by their index.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Emaple:\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "print(lst[0]) \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Mutable:\n",
    "# Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "lst[0] = 10  # Changing first element\n",
    "print(lst)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",

    "# 3. Allows Duplicates:\n",
    "# Lists can contain duplicate elements, meaning the same value can appear multiple times.\n",

    "lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Heterogeneous Elements:\n",
    "# A single list can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other lists or objects.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "lst = [1, \"apple\", 3.14, [2, 3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indexing and Slicing:\n",
    "# Lists support indexing to access elements and slicing to retrieve a sublist.\n",

    "print(lst[1])      # Output: 20\n",
    "print(lst[1:3])    # Output: [20, 30\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Size:\n",
    "# Lists can grow or shrink dynamically by adding or removing elements. You don’t need to declare the size of a list upfront.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "lst.append(4)      # Adds 4 to the list\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variety of Built-in Methods:\n",
    "# Lists have many useful built-in methods like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), and reverse(), allowing easy manipulation.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n",
    "print(matrix[0][1])  # Output: 2\n",

    "\n",
    "#  Iterability:\n",
    "# Lists are iterable, so you can loop through the elements using a for loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary Keys:\n",
    "# Tuples, unlike lists, can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable and hashable. This is especially useful when you need to map data with multiple values (e.g., coordinate pairs or key-value pairs).\n",
